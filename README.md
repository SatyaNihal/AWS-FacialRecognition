# AWS Facial Recognition System

A facial recognition system built with AWS Rekognition, Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, and a Flask web app deployed via Docker.

## Key Idea
- AWS **EC2** for compute environment  
- **S3** for image storage and event triggers  
- **Rekognition** for facial detection and feature extraction  
- **Lambda** for serverless image processing  
- **DynamoDB** for metadata and face print storage  
- **Docker** for deploying the web application
